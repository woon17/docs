# Claude Tips and Best Practices

A collection of tips, tricks, and best practices for working with Claude AI.

## General Usage Tips

### 1. Be Clear and Specific
- Provide detailed context when asking questions
- Use specific examples to illustrate what you need
- Break complex requests into smaller, manageable parts

### 2. Use Structured Prompts
```
Task: [What you want to accomplish]
Context: [Background information]
Requirements: [Specific needs or constraints]
Output: [Desired format or structure]
```

### 3. Iterative Refinement
- Start with a basic request and refine based on results
- Ask follow-up questions to improve outputs
- Provide feedback on what works and what doesn't

## Code-Related Tips

### 1. Provide Context
- Share relevant file structure
- Include existing code snippets
- Mention the programming language and framework

### 2. Ask for Explanations
```
- Explain the logic behind the solution
- Add comments for complex parts
- Suggest alternative approaches
```

### 3. Error Handling
- Share complete error messages
- Provide the code that's causing issues
- Ask for debugging strategies

## Documentation Tips

### 1. Structure Requests
- Request specific formatting (Markdown, bullet points, etc.)
- Ask for examples and code snippets
- Specify target audience level

### 2. Content Organization
- Ask for logical flow and organization
- Request table of contents for longer documents
- Ask for cross-references between related topics

## Productivity Hacks

### 1. Template Creation
Ask Claude to create templates for:
- Project documentation
- Code review checklists
- Meeting notes
- README files

### 2. Batch Processing
- Process multiple similar tasks at once
- Create standardized formats for repeated work
- Use consistent naming conventions

### 3. Learning Acceleration
- Ask for explanations at different complexity levels
- Request practice exercises
- Get recommendations for further learning

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Role-Based Prompting
```
"Act as a senior software architect reviewing this design..."
"As a technical writer, help me improve this documentation..."
"From a security expert's perspective, analyze this code..."
```

### 2. Constraint-Based Problem Solving
- Specify limitations (time, resources, technology)
- Ask for trade-off analysis
- Request multiple solution approaches

### 3. Chain of Thought
- Ask Claude to "think step by step"
- Add "think hard" to get more thorough responses
- Request reasoning behind recommendations
- Ask for pros and cons of different approaches

!!! tip "YouTube Pro Tip"
    Adding "think hard" to your prompts makes Claude provide more detailed, thorough analysis and better reasoning.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

!!! warning "Watch Out For"
    - Assuming Claude knows your specific context without explanation
    - Not providing enough examples for complex tasks
    - Asking too many unrelated questions in one prompt

!!! tip "Best Practices"
    - Always verify code before using in production
    - Cross-reference important information
    - Use Claude as a starting point, not the final answer

## Integration with Development Workflow

### 1. Code Reviews
- Paste code snippets for review
- Ask for security considerations
- Request performance optimization suggestions

### 2. Documentation Writing
- Generate API documentation
- Create user guides
- Write technical specifications

### 3. Problem Solving
- Debug complex issues
- Design system architecture
- Optimize existing solutions

## Useful Prompt Patterns

### For Code Generation
```
Create a [language] function that:
- Does [specific task]
- Takes [parameters]
- Returns [expected output]
- Handles [error cases]
```

### For Explanations
```
Explain [concept] as if I'm:
- A beginner programmer
- An experienced developer
- Someone from a non-technical background
```

### For Analysis
```
Analyze this [code/design/approach] for:
- Performance implications
- Security vulnerabilities  
- Best practice adherence
- Potential improvements
```
