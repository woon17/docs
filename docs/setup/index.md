# Setup Guides

Welcome to setup and configuration guides covering development environment setup for various tools and platforms.

## Overview

This section provides step-by-step setup instructions for development tools, SSH configuration, and environment management across different platforms.

## Available Guides

### Python Environment
- **[Virtual Environment Setup (macOS)](python-vertual-env.md)** - Setting up Python virtual environments on macOS

### SSH Configuration  
- **[GitHub SSH Setup](ssh-github.md)** - Configuring SSH keys for GitHub authentication
- **[Linux Server SSH](ssh-server.md)** - SSH configuration for remote Linux server access

## Getting Started

!!! tip "New Development Environment?"
    Start with the Python virtual environment setup if you're working with Python projects, or SSH configuration if you need secure remote access.

### Setup Workflow
1. **Python Development** - Configure [virtual environments](python-vertual-env.md) for project isolation
2. **GitHub Access** - Set up [SSH keys](ssh-github.md) for seamless repository access  
3. **Remote Servers** - Configure [SSH access](ssh-server.md) to development or production servers

## Best Practices

### Environment Management
- Use virtual environments to isolate project dependencies
- Keep development and production configurations separate
- Document environment requirements and setup steps

### SSH Security
- Use SSH keys instead of passwords for authentication
- Regularly rotate SSH keys for security
- Configure proper permissions for SSH key files

### Version Control
- Never commit sensitive configuration files
- Use environment variables for configuration values
- Document setup procedures for team members
