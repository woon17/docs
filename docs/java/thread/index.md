# Java Threading Guide

This guide covers Java threading concepts, when to use multiple threads, and common patterns for concurrent programming.

## Rule of Thumb
Use multiple threads when work can be done independently and in parallel.

multiple threads can make things worse due to overhead or race conditions.


| Use Case               | Problem with 1 Thread               | Why Multiple Threads Help                     |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Blocking I/O or UI     | Program freezes while waiting       | Other threads keep things running             |
| CPU-intensive task     | Only 1 core is used                 | Multiple cores finish job faster              |
| Many small fast tasks  | One thread processes them slowly    | Pool of threads increases task throughput     |

the 3 use cases show the necessary of using multiple threads, then why need to use aeron (single service, single machine, mutltuple agents in different threads).

this the different topic. please refer to aeron topic ([Aeron](http://127.0.0.1:8000/aeron/adv/)): even different threads, still use aeron agents on different threads.
