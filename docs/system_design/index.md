# System Design

Welcome to system design documentation covering architectural patterns, inter-process communication (IPC), and design principles for building scalable systems.

## Overview

This section covers fundamental concepts and practical implementations for designing distributed systems, with particular focus on high-performance financial and trading systems.

## Topics Covered

### Architecture Fundamentals
- **[Functional vs Non-Functional Requirements](frAndNfre.md)** - Understanding system requirements and trade-offs
- Design patterns for scalable systems
- Performance considerations and bottlenecks

### Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
- **[IPC Overview](IPC/ipc.md)** - Communication mechanisms between processes
- **[Aeron MDC](IPC/aeron_mdc.md)** - High-performance messaging patterns
- Message queuing and event-driven architectures

### Design Principles
- Scalability patterns
- Fault tolerance and resilience
- Load balancing strategies
- Data consistency models

## Getting Started

!!! tip "New to System Design?"
    Start with [Functional vs Non-Functional Requirements](frAndNfre.md) to understand the foundation of system requirements analysis.

### Learning Path
1. **Requirements Analysis** - Learn to identify functional vs non-functional requirements
2. **IPC Mechanisms** - Understand different communication patterns
3. **Architecture Patterns** - Apply design principles to real systems
4. **Performance Optimization** - Implement high-performance solutions
